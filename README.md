# nfl-weather-analysis
A project that explores the effects of weather on scoring in NFL games.

The code I used to perform this analysis is saved [here](https://github.com/pchristenson99/nfl-weather-analysis/tree/main/code), and a write-up summarizing my findings is saved [here](https://github.com/pchristenson99/nfl-weather-analysis/blob/main/nfl-weather-analysis.pdf).
